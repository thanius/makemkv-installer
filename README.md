# MakeMKV Installer v1.2

This is an automated script to download and install the trial version of MakeMKV. It can be deployed and executed on a schedule per 90 days to always be up to date.
It has been tested with Ubuntu 23.10, it uses the required packages as described on the MakeMKV forums.

This script has been created for my own needs, be sure to support the developer by purchasing a proper license!
